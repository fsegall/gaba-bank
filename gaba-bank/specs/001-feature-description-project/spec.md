# Feature Specification: Defy Invest MVP (Frontend-Only with Mocks)

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-description-project`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Project Specification: Defy Invest MVP (Frontend-Only with Mocks) ## 1. Scope This specification is for a **standalone frontend application**. All backend interactions, including blockchain transactions (Soroban), database calls (PostgreSQL), and external APIs (PIX), **MUST be simulated** using a local mock data service. The goal is to build the complete user interface and user experience, which will be integrated with a live backend in a future phase. ## 2. Core Features & Pages ### 2.1. Landing Page - **Default State (Unconnected Wallet):** Displays the headline 'Decentralized Community Bank - Stellar' with three CTAs: 'Invest', 'Get Funding', and 'Open an Account'. - **Connected State:** Adapts to a personalized view showing a 'Welcome back!' message, the user's (mock) vault balance, and replaces the default CTAs with 'Deposit More' and 'Withdraw' buttons. ### 2.2. Vault (Earn) Page - **Purpose:** The core DeFi feature where users can manage their investments. - **Content:** Displays mock metrics for PPS, TVL, and Total Shares. Features 'Deposit' and 'Withdraw' buttons that trigger a 3-step modal. Includes a table of the user's mock transaction history. ### 2.3. Stubs & Other Pages - **Crowdfunding Stub:** A static page with a hero, placeholder cards ('Start a campaign', 'Browse campaigns'), and 'Coming soon' badges. - **Wallets Stub:** A static page showing a mock asset list (XLM, USDC, BRLD) with disabled 'Send/Receive' buttons and a 'Feature coming soon' banner. - **Wallet Connect Page:** A modal or page to simulate connecting with the Freighter wallet. ## 3. Core User Flows - **Vault Deposit/Withdrawal:** A 3-step modal process (Input, Review, Sign & Track) that simulates a successful or failed transaction using mock data. - **Wallet Connection:** A flow that simulates a user connecting and disconnecting their wallet, updating the UI accordingly. ## 4. Key Requirements - **FR-001:** System MUST be a standalone frontend application (e.g., Next.js) with no backend dependency. - **FR-002:** System MUST implement a mock service layer to provide static data for all dynamic UI elements (KPIs, balances, transaction history). - **FR-003:** The mock service MUST simulate both successful and failed transaction states for deposits and withdrawals. - **FR-004:** The landing page MUST adapt its content based on the (mock) wallet connection status. - **FR-005:** System MUST display a persistent 'TESTNET' badge in the UI header. - **FR-006:** All accessibility standards (AA contrast, focus rings, ARIA attributes) MUST be met."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to connect my wallet to the application, view my investment vault, and simulate depositing and withdrawing funds so that I can test the core DeFi functionality of the platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1.  **Given** a user has not connected their wallet, **When** they visit the landing page, **Then** they see the headline 'Decentralized Community Bank - Stellar' and CTAs for 'Invest', 'Get Funding', and 'Open an Account'.
2.  **Given** a user has connected their wallet, **When** they visit the landing page, **Then** they see a 'Welcome back!' message, their mock vault balance, and CTAs for 'Deposit More' and 'Withdraw'.
3.  **Given** a user is on the Vault page, **When** they click 'Deposit', **Then** a 3-step modal appears for inputting, reviewing, and simulating the signing of the transaction.
4.  **Given** a user is on the Vault page, **When** they click 'Withdraw', **Then** a 3-step modal appears for inputting, reviewing, and simulating the signing of the transaction.
5.  **Given** a user completes a deposit or withdrawal flow successfully, **When** they view their transaction history, **Then** the new mock transaction is displayed.
6.  **Given** a user completes a deposit or withdrawal flow with a simulated failure, **When** they view their transaction history, **Then** no new transaction is displayed and an error message is shown.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to interact with disabled features on stub pages (Crowdfunding, Wallets)? The user should see a "Coming soon" or "Feature coming soon" indicator.
- How does the system handle a user disconnecting their wallet? The UI should revert from the "Connected State" to the "Default State".

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST be a standalone frontend application with no backend dependency.
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement a mock service layer to provide static data for all dynamic UI elements (KPIs, balances, transaction history).
- **FR-003**: The mock service MUST simulate both successful and failed transaction states for deposits and withdrawals.
- **FR-004**: The landing page MUST adapt its content based on the (mock) wallet connection status.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a persistent 'TESTNET' badge in the UI header.
- **FR-006**: All accessibility standards (AA contrast, focus rings, ARIA attributes) MUST be met.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a page or modal to simulate connecting with the Freighter wallet.
- **FR-008**: System MUST display mock metrics for PPS, TVL, and Total Shares on the Vault page.
- **FR-009**: System MUST include static stub pages for 'Crowdfunding' and 'Wallets' with 'Coming soon' indicators.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Wallet**: Represents the user's connection status and mock asset balances (XLM, USDC, BRLD).
- **Vault**: Represents the user's investment, with attributes like balance, PPS, TVL, and Total Shares.
- **Transaction**: Represents a deposit or withdrawal action, with attributes like type, amount, status (success/fail), and timestamp.
