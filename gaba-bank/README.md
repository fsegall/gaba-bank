# Defy Invest MVP - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend application for the Defy Invest MVP, a decentralized community banking platform built on Stellar.

This is a **standalone frontend application**. All backend interactions, including blockchain transactions (Soroban), database calls, and external APIs, are **simulated** using a local mock data service (MSW).

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Wallet Connection**: Simulate connecting a Freighter wallet to the application.
- **Dynamic Landing Page**: The UI adapts based on the user's wallet connection status.
- **DeFi Vault**: A core feature where users can view mock metrics (TVL, PPS) and a history of their simulated deposit and withdrawal transactions.
- **Multi-Step Transactions**: A 3-step modal flow (Input, Review, Result) for deposits and withdrawals.
- **Stub Pages**: Placeholder pages for future Crowdfunding and Wallet management features.
- **TESTNET Mode**: A persistent "TESTNET" badge is displayed in the header to indicate the application is in a testing state.

- **Framework**: React (with Vite)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Stellar Design System & Tailwind CSS (via `@stellar/design-system`)
